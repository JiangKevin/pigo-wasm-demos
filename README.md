This repository is a collection of real time Webassembly demos based on the [Pigo](https://github.com/esimov/pigo) face detection library, showing various use cases the library can be used for. It's continuously updated.

## Install
**Notice: at least Go 1.13 is required prior running the demos!**

```bash
$ go get -u -v github.com/esimov/pigo-wasm-demos 

```

## Run
To run the demos is as simple as typing a single line of command. This will build the package and produce an executable WebAssembly file which can be served over a http server. A new window will be opened in the user's default browser.

```bash
$ make demo<number>
```

Check the `Makefile` for the existing demos.
